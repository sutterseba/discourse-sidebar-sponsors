# Discourse Sidebar Sponsors

Replace `sponsor_logo_1.png` and `sponsor_logo_2.png` with a **420 x 100** PNG logo. These images will replace the first and second links in the "Forum Sponsors" custom section respectively.

The links for the sponsor logos themselves are edited in Discourse:

![](/docs/sidebar_edit.png)

![](/docs/sidebar_editor.png)

When changes to the logos are made here on GitHub, update the forum by navigating to `/admin/customize/themes` -> **Components** -> **Techlore Sidebar Sponsors** and selecting **Check for Updates**.
